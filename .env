# Based on https://github.com/symfony/dotenv
#
# In all environments, the following files are loaded if they exist,
# the latter taking precedence over the former:
#
#  * .env                contains default values for the environment variables needed by the app
#  * .env.local          uncommitted file with local overrides
#  * .env.$APP_ENV       committed environment-specific defaults
#  * .env.$APP_ENV.local uncommitted environment-specific overrides
#
# Real environment variables win over .env files. !!!
#
# DO NOT DEFINE PRODUCTION SECRETS IN THIS FILE NOR IN ANY OTHER COMMITTED FILES.

# Environment
APP_ENV=dev # this is usually overriten by System/Docker
APP_DEBUG=0 # do not rely on Dontenv conversion based on env, enforce no-debug by default
